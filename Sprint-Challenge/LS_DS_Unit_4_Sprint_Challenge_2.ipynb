    "\n",
    "- **Neuron:**\n",
    "\n",
    "_An artificial neuron is a mathematical function conceived as a model of biological neurons, a neural network. Artificial neurons are elementary units in an artificial neural network. The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials at neural dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (or activation, representing a neuron's action potential which is transmitted along its axon). Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded. The thresholding function has inspired building logic gates referred to as threshold logic; applicable to building logic circuits resembling brain processing. For example, new devices such as memristors have been extensively used to develop such logic in recent times._\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "_The Input Layer is what receives input from our dataset. Sometimes it is called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly. Typically node maps are drawn with one input node for each of the different inputs/features/columns of our dataset that will be passed to the network._\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Layers after the input layer are called Hidden Layers. This is because they cannot be accessed except through the input layer. They're inside of the network and they perform their functions, but we don't directly interact with them._\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Layer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "_The purpose of the output layer is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem that we're trying to address._\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity to neural networks. It squashes the values in a smaller range viz. a Sigmoid activation function squashes values between a range 0 to 1. There are many activation functions used in deep learning industry and ReLU, SeLU and TanH are preferred over sigmoid activation function. In this article I have explained the different activation functions available._\n",

    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backpropagation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "_Iterative, recursive and efficient method for calculating the weights updates to improve the network until it is able to perform the task for which it is being trained. It is closely related to the Gaussâ€“Newton algorithm._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Backpropagation requires the derivatives of activation functions to be known at network design time. Automatic differentiation is a technique that can automatically and analytically provide the derivatives to the training algorithm. In the context of learning, backpropagation is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function; backpropagation computes the gradient(s), whereas (stochastic) gradient descent uses the gradients for training the model (via optimization)._"
